Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering is a systematic application, in that it follows a set of principles from designing, testing, deployment and maintenance of software  which aims to produse reliable, scable and maintanable software products to the end users.
In contrast, traditional programming focuses primarily on writing code to solve a spefic problem while sofware engineering addresses the entire software development life cycle.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Software development life cycle consists of the following phases:
1. Requirement: This phases involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: This phase involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: This phase involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: This phase involves Conducting various tests to ensure the sofware meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: This hase involves releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
- Agile uses an iterative and incremental approach which is focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change while Waterfall uses a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g, requiresments, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall, in which one step must be completed before going to the next.
- Scenarios
    - Agile is required in scenarios which are adaptable to change like dynamic projects, Customer-centric projects while waterfall is required in scenarios which are fixed from the start like Regulatory compliance projects-government

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
- Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements.
-It involves processes such as 
1. Elicitation - The main objective is to gather requirements from stakeholders by interviews and documents analysis. This initiates a set of requirements.
2. Analysis - This process analyzes and refines the gathered requirements to to identify conflicts and feasibility.
3. Specifications - This process documents the requirements in a clear and detailed manner.
4. Validation - This process ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflects the needs and expectations of the stakeholder.
5. Management - This process manages changes to requirements throughout the project life cycle.
-  Software requirements is imporntant in the software development life cycle in that it provides the basis for practical testing which ensures that the software meets stakeholder's needs.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
- Modularity in in software design is the practice of breaking down a system into smaller, manageable and independent modules or components.
- It improves maintainability by isolating changes. When a module needs to be updated or fixed, the impact is limited to that specific module, reducing the risk of unintended consequences in other parts of the system.
- It improves scalability in that it allows for easier intergration of new features or components. New modules can be added without affecting existing one, making it easier to extend the functionality of the syatem.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
-There are four Levels of software testing:
1. Unit testing - This involves testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration testing - This involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System Testing - This involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing - This involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meents user needs.
- Testing is crucial in software development because it identifies potential issues before they reach the end user, thus reducing the likelihood of software failures and the associated financial and repetitional tasks.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
- Version control systems are softwre tools used to manage changes to source codes, documents and othe files.
-They are imporntant in software development because they enhance history tracking, collaboration and backup which are crucial for software development projects.
-Examples include: 
1. Git
    - Features: Distributed version control, branching and merging.
2. Subversion (SVN)
    - Features: Centralized version control, atomic commits, directory versioning.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
-Roles of a software project manager:
    - Project planning from start to the end.
    - Assigning tasks, providing guidance and monitoring the progress of the team.
    - Monitoring and managing risks throughout the project life cycle.
    - Allocting project resources effectively to ensure the success of the project.
    - Evaluating changes requests and the impact it is going to cause on the project.
- Challenges faced:
    - The tendency of projects to requirements to expand beyond the initial scope which leads to delays and budget overruns.
    - Management of project timelines and deadlines to ensure timely complition of projects.
    - Ensuring Quality assurance standards are met.
    - Identifying and mitigting project risks, e.g, technical challenges.
    - Ensuring effective communication among team members and other project stakeholders to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
- Software maintenance is the practice of modifying and updating software after it has been deployed.
- Maintenance activities:
    1. Corrective maintenance - This mainly invoves bug fixing.
    2. Adaptive Maintenance- This involves modifying the software to adapt to changes in the environment, i.e, operating system
    3. Perfective maintenance - This involves improving or enhancing  he software to add new features, improve performanceor enhance usability based on eveolving reuirements.
    4. Preventive Maintenance - This aims to prevent future issues by proactively identifying and addressing potential problems before they occur.

- Maintenance is essential in the software lifecycle because it helps to correct faults, improve performance and adapt the software to a changing environment throughout it's lifetime.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
- Ethical issues that software engineers might face:
    - Privacy - This majorly involves processing user date without their consent.
    - Weak Security - A software engineer may develop software that is prone to vulnerability and exploitation by malicious actors.
    - Transparency -This majorly comes in when a software engineer fails to disclose how the software operates leading to llackof transparency and trust.
- Adherance to ethical Standards:
    1. Software engineers should stay informed about ethical issues in the field and seek training on how to address them.
        Reference: IEEE Code of Ethics
    2. Software engineers should adhere to professional code of ethics, such as ACM Code of ethics and professional conduct, which provides guidelines to ethical behaviour in software engineering.
        Reference: ACM Code of Ethics
    3. Design software with ethical considerations in mind, such as privacy, security, and fairness.
        Reference: Ethical Design Manifesto
    4. Be transparent about how software operates and how user data is used, providing clear explanations to users.
    5.  Conduct risk assessments to identify potential ethical issues in software development and deployment.
    6. Seek advice from colleagues, supervisors, or ethics committees when faced with ethical dilemmas.
